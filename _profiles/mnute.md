Mike is a Research Scientist in the Treangen Lab and has been a part of the lab since joining as a Postdoc in 2020 except for a brief stint away to work on a startup. He received his Ph.D. in Statistics in 2019 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he was advised by Dr. Tandy Warnow in the Department of Computer Science and worked on algorithms related to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree estimation, in particular applying these methods to studying microbial communities. He was co-advised by Dr. Rebecca Stumpf in the Department of Anthropology where he and other lab members developed novel methods to compare the microbiomes of human and non-human primates. From 2012 to 2014 he was also an assistant coach for the [Illini Rowing Club](https://illinirowing.com).

As part of the Treangen Lab he has provided leadership and guidance on numerous software tools our lab has developed, including: Bakdrive {% cite wang2023bakdrive %}, Emu {% cite curry2022emu %}, Komb {% cite balaji2020komb %}, Lemur {% cite sapoval2024lightweight %}, Parsnp 2.0 {% cite kille2024parsnp %}, SeqScreen-Nano {% cite balaji2023seqscreen %}, and more. He has been a co-author on a number of additional publications from the lab, including a pilot study showing a possible relationship between sport-related traumatic brain injury and pro-inflamatory changes to the gut microbiome {% cite soriano2022alterations %} and several review papers {% cite curry2021takes kille2022multiple sapoval2022current %}. 

Mike’s ongoing research interests include:
- Improving Parsnp, the lab’s multiple genome alignment software, to extend its alignment beyond the core genome.
- Experimenting with new ways to explore microbial community structures using unsupervised deep-learning models. 
- Comparative genomics of _Clostridioides Difficile_. 
- Untangling the potential for the tumor microenvironment in human cancer to host resident microbes that affect patient prognosis, particularly in solid tumors.
- …among others.

Previously, Mike was a [NLM Biomedical Informatics postdoctoral fellow](https://www.gulfcoastconsortia.org/home/training/bmi-nlm/), funded by NIH grant T15LM007093. Current funding includes NIH NIAID P01 (P01AI152999), NIH NIAID GCID (U19AI144297) and NSF MIM (EF 2126387).

Mike also has a vibrant domestic life as a supportive spouse and father of three. He is the coach of the 2024-2025 [Minuteman Sparks](https://minutemansparks.com) Mite Major “Red” hockey team.
