Mike (Research Scientist) received his Ph.D. in Statistics in 2019 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he was advised by Dr. Tandy Warnow in the Department of Computer Science and worked on algorithms related to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree estimation, in particular applying these methods to studying microbial communities. He was co-advised by Dr. Rebecca Stumpf in the Department of Anthropology where he and other lab members developed novel methods to compare the microbiomes of human and non-human primates. Previously, Mike was a [NLM Biomedical Informatics postdoctoral fellow](https://www.gulfcoastconsortia.org/home/training/bmi-nlm/), funded by NIH grant T15LM007093. His research interest is in discovering a new applications for our understanding of microbial communities and metagenomic analysis. Mike has provided leadership and guidance on numerous software tools our lab has developed, including: Bakdrive, Emu, Komb, Lemur, Parsnp 2.0, SeqScreen-Nano, and more.
