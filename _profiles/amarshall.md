Austin (1st year postdoc) received his BS in Biomolecular Science and PhD in Biotechnology from Clarkson University. As a graduate student, he researched applications of nanopore sequencing technology on many environmental sample types. His projects included built environment aerobiome sampling and analysis and spatial characterization of water from the St. Lawrence River. Nearing the end of his PhD, Austin interned at NASA Johnson Space Center with the microbiology department where he performed temporal evaluation of microbiomes within dust samples from the International Space Station. Austin was recently awarded the NLM BMI postdoctoral fellowship (Grant No. T15 LM007093-32) to receive formal training in biomedical informatics and data science. One of his main interests is applying bioinformatics to better understand the relationship of microbes to their environment and host.
