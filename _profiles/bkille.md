Bryce (4th year PhD student, Computer Science) received his MS in Bioinformatics and BS in 
Computer Science + Chemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As an 
undergraduate, he worked at Dow Agrosciences in both the computational biology and cheminformatics 
groups. His projects included developing software for phylogeny analysis and creating models for 
compound activity prediction. During his Masterâ€™s program, Bryce worked in a biochemistry lab 
developing software for genome mining as well as a on research project for creating bit-wise 
algorithms for the C++ STL. One of his main interests is casting biological and chemical problems 
into theoretical computer science questions. 

As a PhD student, Bryce has worked on a range of sequence-analysis applications, such as 
genome alignment {% cite kille2023minmers kille2024parsnp} and variant calling 
{% cite kille2021accelerating}. 
Bryce is currently a [NLM Biomedical Informatics predoctoral fellow](https://www.gulfcoastconsortia.org/home/training/bmi-nlm/) 
(NIH grant T15LM007093).
