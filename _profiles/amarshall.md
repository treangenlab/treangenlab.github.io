Austin (postdoctoral fellow) received his BS in Biomolecular Science and PhD in Biotechnology from Clarkson University. As a graduate student, he researched applications of nanopore sequencing technology on many environmental sample types. His projects included low-biomass aerosol sampling and analysis as well as spatial characterization of water microbiomes from the St. Lawrence River see more about the Lampsilis 2022 mission [here](https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/what-goes-in-the-water). Nearing the end of his PhD, Austin interned at NASA Johnson Space Center with the [JSC microbiology team](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/microbiology/) where he performed temporal evaluation of microbiomes within dust samples from the International Space Station using both amplicon and metagenomic nanopore sequencing. 

In January of 2024, Austin joined our collaborators in the [Villapol Lab](https://villapol.hmailabs.org/) at Houston Methodist Research Institute. He was recently awarded the NLM BMI postdoctoral fellowship (NIH T15 LM007093-32) leading him to work closely with the Treangen Lab and receive formal training in biomedical informatics and data science. One of his main interests is applying bioinformatics to better understand the relationship of microbes to their environment and host. In his free time, Austin enjoys fishing, pickleball, and gardening with his partner Lauren and dog Cooper.
