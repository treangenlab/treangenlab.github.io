Dr. Treangen formed the Treangen Lab in July 2018. Given the computational challenges presented by the metagenomic data deluge, coupled with the time-sensitive nature of problems specific to tracking pandemics and synthetic DNA screening, the Treangen lab strives to develop efficient and accurate computational solutions to emerging problems in these fields. Specifically, his research group focuses on the design, development, and implementation of novel algorithms, heuristics, and data structures to solve emerging computational research questions specific to biosecurity, infectious disease monitoring, and host-associated microbiome characterization. The Treangen lab is also dedicated to the dissemination and development of novel open-source bioinformatics methods, software, and pipelines, and to providing “hands on” research opportunities to Rice undergraduates.
