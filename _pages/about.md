Welcome to the Treangen lab website, a bioinformatics and computational biology research group at Rice University, led by Dr. Todd J. Treangen (Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and affiliated Associate Professor in the Department of Bioengineering). 

Since launching in 2018, the Treangen lab has focused on developing scalable and accurate computational algorithms, methods, and open-source software tools to answer research questions specific to: (i) identifying and characterizing known and novel microbial pathogens, (ii) population scale microbial genome variation and evolution, and (iii) studying microbial communities across time and space in the environment and human-host-associated microbiomes.

The Treangen lab is actively funded by CDC, NIH (NIA, NIAID), and NSF (EF, IIS, SHF). Prior support from: c3.ai DTI, DHS, IARPA, and NIH.
