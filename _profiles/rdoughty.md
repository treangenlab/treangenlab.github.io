Ryan (2nd year PhD student, Computer Science), obtained his BS in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University. During his undergraduate studies, he worked with Dr. Treangen on large-scale wastewater analyses and targeted metagenomic sequencing methods. He also spent six months in Vigo, Spain, working in Dr. David Posada’s lab, focusing on gut-virome biomarkers in colorectal cancer. Additionally, he interned at Intellia Therapeutics for a summer, where he contributed to developing machine learning methods for CRISPR Cas-9 guide design. Ryan's current research interests center around string algorithms for high-performance genomics and comprehending the global virosphere through viral genomic analyses. Ryan is supported by a training fellowship from the Gulf Coast Consortia, on the NLM Training Program in Biomedical Informatics & Data Science (T15LM007093)
