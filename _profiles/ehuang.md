Eddy (3rd year PhD student, Computer Science) obtained a B.S. degree with Honors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from North Carolina State University. Before she entered the journey of computer science, she obtained a B.S. degree in Preventive Medicine from the Southwest Medical University in China and spent a year working as a chronic disease analyst at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zigong city. During her study at NCSU, Eddy did research in multi-agent reinforcement learning in social computing. Her primary research interests are in the area of computational biology with a focus on microbial community analysis and applications of deep learning in heterogeneous multi-omics data analysis. Outside the lab, Eddy dedicates her life to rock climbing and she believes the philosophy of solving a climbing puzzle harmonizes with the research activities of a computer scientist.

Eddy is supported by NSF (CCF 2313062) and NSF MIM (EF 2126387).
