Rossie (1st year PhD student, SSPB). Rossie worked in the synthetic biology industry for two years before starting her PhD program in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology (SSPB) at Rice. 
Her current research focuses on microbial metagenomics 
with strain-level comparative analysis to identify potential 
virulence factors. She is also working on expanding the 
features and applications of Parsnp, a fast and robust 
whole genome alignment tool. 
Her main interests are exploring the genotype-phenotype 
relationships while developing tools to enable and 
accelerate biological discoveries. In particular, she wants to 
learn more about the impact of genetic differences on 
protein structure/function and ultimately the fitness of an 
organism in a specific environment.

Outside of research, she enjoys nature, running and spending time with her dog.
