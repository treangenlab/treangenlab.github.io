Felix (3rd year PhD Student, Computer Science) received his BS in Computer Science at Lehigh University. During his undergraduate studies, he worked on biophysical and structural biology, exploring the intersection between molecular dynamics and pattern recognition to predict protein-protein and protein-ligand binding. Before entering his PhD program, he worked as a software validation engineer for Intel Corporation, validating legacy security technologies for existing and upcoming enterprise products. His current focus is on protein function in the age of big data and the subsequent effects of function prediction from generative methods. In his free time, he enjoys running and watching movies with his cats.
